		<h2>About GEOGLAM Map</h2>
        <p><strong>GEOGLAM Map</strong> is a website for map-based access to information about the state and condition of global rangelands. It provides time-based data on the resources used by livestock, allowing country and regional tracking of livestock production including production of meat, wool, and milk. It has been developed, and is currently hosted, by <a href="http://www.nicta.com.au/">NICTA</a> for the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring Rangeland And Pasture Productivity (<a href="http://www.geo-rapp.org/">GEOGLAM RAPP</a>). This website is an extension of the Australian Government's <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/">National Map</a> initiative.</p>

        <p><strong>GEOGLAM Map</strong> is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically accessing the data directly from the custodian of that data.</p>

        The main datasets provided by <strong>GEOGLAM Map</strong> are:
        <ul>
            <li>Rangeland and pasture cover
            <li>Plant available water content
        </ul>

        while ancilliary datasets include:
        <ul>
            <li>Environmental including rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture
            <li>Livestock use including biomass use, production, feed efficiency, excretion, and greenhouse gas emissions
        </ul>

        <p>To see the data in more detail, please refer to the Data Catalogue in the <a href="http://map.geo-rapp.org">GEOGLAM Map</a> itself. Click the <b>Data Catalogue</b> tab and expand the Data Set group names.</p>

        <h2>How to use GEOGLAM Map</h2>

        <p>Just go to <a href="http://map.geo-rapp.org">http://map.geo-rapp.org</a>. Most operations are obvious,

        <h2>GEOGLAM Map Software</h2>

        <p>GEOGLAM Map is Open Source software available as a
        <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/geoglam-nm" target="_blank">Github project</a>. The core platform, <a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" target="_blank">TerriaJS</a>, was initially
        developed by NICTA for the NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available
        to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>

        <h2>Additional Open Source Software Used</h2>

        <p>In developing the NationalMap that GEOGLAM Map is based on, NICTA has used open source software and contributed back to it.  NationalMap leverages these excellent open source libraries:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs" target="_blank">TerriaJS</a></li>

          <li><a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a></li>
          <li>The <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap/blob/master/LICENSE.md">complete list</a> is available with the <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap">NationalMap source code</a></li>
