GEOGLAM Map
============

[GEOGLAM Map](http://geoglamweblink) is a website for map-based access to information about the state and condition of global rangelands. It provides time-based data on the resources used by livestock, allowing country and regional tracking of livestock production including production of meat, wool, and milk.

The main datasets are:
* Rangeland and pasture cover
* Plant available water content

Ancilliary datasets include:
* Environmental: rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture
* Livestock use: biomass use, production, feed efficiency, excretion, and greenhouse gas emissions

GEOGLAM Map is based on NICTA's Open Source TerriaJS web geospatial platform: https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs
